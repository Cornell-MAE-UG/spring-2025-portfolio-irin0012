**[INTRODUCTION]:**

The Agricultural Experiential Robotics Platform (AgXRP) is a pioneering effort to enhance k-12 educational experiences by blending robotics and agriculture. This project strategically targets students traditionally less inclined towards conventional STEM subjects, aiming to boost their engagement by demonstrating the practical applications and interdisciplinary nature of agricultural robotics. 

**[OBJECTIVES]:**

-Facilitate simple deployment of the AgXRP for non-robotic experts through reduction in design and assembly complexity by strategically replacing bolts, optimizing axis design, building mechanical mounts for sensors.

-Integration of new sensors and display (firmware and hardware) such as a time-of-flight sensors, capacitive soil moisture sensors, RGB camera, LCD screen. 

-Functional validation of system performance and efficacy as an accessible educational tool through testing with real crop growing and deployment in local 4-H program through testing and feedback from the pilot program in Saratoga County Cornell Cooperative Extension.

-The AgXRP seeks to establish a global community focused on transforming agricultural education, making STEM concepts tangible, relevant, and impactful for the next generation.
